hopscotch cruise drift float hike meander
carving divide engrave etch fashion hack
sprayed dust scatter shoot shower smear
decides choose conclude determine elect end
distract bewilder detract disturb divert entertain
glide drift flit float fly sail
crushed break bruise crumble mash squash
wasting consume deplete dissipate divert drain
unpack unload unbox uncrate unlade
zooming dart dash dive flash hurtle
guzzle gobble imbibe quaff slosh swig
wallpaper hang plaster wallpaper
jogging shake shove whack arouse dig
pumping draw inject pour push send
squirts spatter spit splash spray sprinkle
behaving operate perform react take work
complain criticize denounce disagree fret gripe
bundled pack wrap bind fasten tie
serves distribute give handle hit play
ridden drift drive float go guide
rifle burgle despoil grab gut loot
transcribing duplicate interpret reprint reproduce rewrite
quail blench cringe droop faint falter
bonked collide crash drive force knock
afford manage incur spare stand support
screech shout shriek squeal yell shrill
scraping grind rub shave bark bray
babysitting sit tend watch
pinched crush hurt squeeze tweak compress
crumpled buckle crush scrunch crease crimp
protecting conserve cover cushion defend insulate
screwing turn twine wind work
steamroller force overpower overwhelm
rowing sail swim oar pull punt
pours discharge drain flood flow gush
soak bathe dip drink drown flood
shaved kiss pare prune shear shred
zzz doze languish relax snooze catnap
waddle totter wiggle wobble shuffle sway
shiver quiver shudder vibrate freeze palpitate
toots declare proclaim shout spree trumpet
